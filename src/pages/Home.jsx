                <h2>What is Bouldering?</h2>
                <p>Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses. 
</p>
                <p>Unlike <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouldering" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">traditional climbing</a>, bouldering focuses on short but intensive routes called "problems," typically keeping climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.

              <p>Experience the perfect blend of <strong>physical challenge and mental puzzle-solving</strong> as you navigate routes close to the ground, with nothing but a crash pad and determination. Bouldering strips climbing down to its purest form, making it both <strong>accessible to beginners and endlessly challenging for experts.</strong>
